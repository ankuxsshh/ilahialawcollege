        <h3>About Course</h3>
        <p class="text-justify">The Integrated Double Degree Course in Law is a five-year academic program that
          combines a Bachelor’s degree in any discipline with a Bachelor’s degree in Law (LL.B.), as
          per the curriculum designed by the respective university. This integrated course adheres to
          the guidelines established by the Bar Council of India (BCI) under its authority derived from
          the Advocates Act, 1961. Upon successful completion of the program, the degree
          awarded is recognised for the purpose of enrolment as an Advocate under the provisions
          of the Advocates Act, 1961.</p>
        <p class="text-justify"> The program requires students to complete five academic years of rigorous study,
          ensuring a strong foundation in both their chosen discipline and legal education. The final
          six months of the last year include a mandatory practical training component, designed to
          provide hands-on legal experience and exposure to real-world legal practice. This
          combination of academic learning and practical training equips graduates with the
          necessary skills and knowledge to excel in the legal profession.</p>
