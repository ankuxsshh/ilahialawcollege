          <h3>About Course</h3>
          <p>The Integrated Double Degree Course in Law is a five-year academic program that 
combines a Bachelor’s degree in any discipline with a Bachelor’s degree in Law (LL.B.), as 
per the curriculum designed by the respective university. This integrated course adheres to 
the guidelines established by the Bar Council of India (BCI) under its authority derived from 
the Advocates Act, 1961. Upon successful completion of the program, the degree 
awarded is recognised for the purpose of enrolment as an Advocate under the provisions 
of the Advocates Act, 1961.</p>
          <p> The program requires students to complete five academic years of rigorous study, 
ensuring a strong foundation in both their chosen discipline and legal education. The final 
six months of the last year include a mandatory practical training component, designed to 
provide hands-on legal experience and exposure to real-world legal practice. This 
combination of academic learning and practical training equips graduates with the 
necessary skills and knowledge to excel in the legal profession.</p>
